# Audio Analyzer

A comprehensive desktop application for audio analysis and visualization built with Python and PyQt6. This tool provides both single audio file analysis and dual audio file comparison capabilities with real-time playback and multiple visualization modes.

## Features

### üéµ Single Audio Analysis
- **Waveform Visualization**: View time-domain representation of audio signals
- **Frequency Spectrum**: Analyze frequency content with FFT-based spectrum analysis
- **Power Spectral Density**: Examine power distribution across frequencies
- **Spectrogram**: Time-frequency representation showing how spectral content changes over time
- **Chromagram**: Visualize harmonic content and chord progressions
- **Tempogram**: Analyze rhythmic patterns and tempo variations
- **Tonnetz**: Display tonal relationships and harmonic networks

### üîÑ Dual Audio Comparison
- Side-by-side comparison of two audio files
- Synchronized visualization across multiple analysis types
- Perfect for A/B testing, audio quality comparison, and forensic analysis

### üéÆ Interactive Features
- **Real-time Playback**: Play audio with synchronized visualization updates
- **Live Animation**: Watch analysis plots update in real-time during playback
- **CUDA Support**: Automatic GPU acceleration when available
- **Multiple Format Support**: WAV, MP3, FLAC audio file formats

## Usage

### Single Audio Analysis

1. Launch the application
2. Click "Select Audio File" to load your audio file
3. Choose from available analysis types:
   - **Waveform**: Basic time-domain visualization
   - **Frequency Spectrum**: FFT-based frequency analysis
   - **Power Spectral Density**: Power distribution analysis
   - **Spectrogram**: Time-frequency heatmap
   - **Chromagram**: Harmonic content visualization
   - **Tempogram**: Rhythmic pattern analysis
   - **Tonnetz**: Tonal relationship mapping
4. Use playback controls to play audio with synchronized visualization

### Dual Audio Comparison

1. Select "Dual Audio Comparison" from the side menu
2. Load two audio files using the respective "Select Audio File" buttons
3. Choose your analysis type to compare both files side-by-side
4. Analyze differences in spectral content, harmonic structure, or rhythmic patterns

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Separate widgets for single and dual analysis modes
- **Caching System**: Intelligent plot caching for improved performance
- **Real-time Processing**: Live audio analysis during playback
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Performance Optimizations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Audio playback not working:**
- Ensure your system has audio output devices configured
- Check that sounddevice can access your audio system
- On Linux, you may need to install additional audio libraries

**FFmpeg errors:**
- The application includes FFmpeg binaries, but if you encounter issues, ensure FFmpeg is properly installed on your system
- Check file permissions for the ffmpeg directory

**Performance issues:**
- For large audio files, consider using shorter segments for analysis
- Ensure you have sufficient RAM for the audio file size
- CUDA acceleration requires compatible NVIDIA GPU and drivers
